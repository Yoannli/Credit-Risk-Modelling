# Credit Scoring Model Project

## Overview

This project involves building a credit scoring model using Python with Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines (SVM) on the [HMEQ dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/ajay1735/hmeq-data). The goal is to assess the creditworthiness of customers by predicting their likelihood of default using a combination of exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model evaluation.

The project is divided into two parts:

1. **Prototype Model Development**: Using Logistic Regression and SVM on the original dataset.
2. **Imbalanced Data Simulation**: Reducing the proportion of "bad" cases to 1% and testing the model's performance with and without SMOTE. **Using the SMOTE algorithm, we have a much stronger AUPRC.**
